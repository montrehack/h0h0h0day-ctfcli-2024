    The elfs have forgotten how to use the gift wrapper machine!
    They can't remember on which side to put the bow.

hints:
    - Following the Christmas values, we should probably call the gift() function.
    - Can you control the value of the wrapped gift?
    - Don't overthink it! Are you using everything under your control?
