  During the holidays, small businesses cannot catch a break from hackers, and OPain is no exception. This family-owned bakery recently put online an online ordering system for their breads. Their largest customers use it to place orders in bulk and get a discount.

  However, the ordering system is the target of malicious crumb-inals who try to subvert the system to get a larger discount they are not entitled to.

  I placed a secret discount code in the system. Can you find it?
