  "Come on, move it diddly doo, dear colleague elf!" says your elf-boss, Alabaster Snowball. You just arrived at your new job in the gift packing facility and it's way faster than you thought.
  To be honest, you kinda hate his guts... And you are not into their disgustingly sweet way of life. You wanna get his gift.
  Because, yes, all elves also get gifts, and its time for you to get Alabaster's gift. He is not diddly doo nice, you find.
