  Santa's elves have created a new kitchen helper to process Christmas recipes more efficiently. 
  However, they're a bit worried about the security of their new tool. 
  Some elves have been complaining about strange outputs when processing recipes from unknown sources.
  Can you help investigate if there's something wrong with their recipe processor?
