  Santa Claus has a new website to keep track of who's naughty and nice!
  Since he doesn't want to be sued for privacy violations, he's made sure that
  the website censor any naughty words.

  The flag is split into 3 parts, each starting with "<index>_" (ex. 1_f00).
  The final flag is obtained by concatenating all the parts without the index: 
  [1_f00, 2_b4r, 3_b4z] -> FLAG-f00_b4r_b4z
