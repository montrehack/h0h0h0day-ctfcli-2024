  Santa comes into the packing factory, he is smiling, like always, but he seems worried.
  He hops onto a box and yells: 
  "My dear diddly doo beautiful hard-working elves. Someone stole a gift! Because of this ood-ylddid sad event.
  You know how we say that one ood-ylddid rotten snowflakes makes the whole snow ood-ylddid bad? Everyone here is ood-ylddid fired tonight.
  You will be replaced by new snowflakes starting midnight." He then smiles again and leaves!
  What a ood-ylddid rotten snowflake he is! I think you want the gift he gives to himself, no?
